## Complex Multi-Part Questions

### Example 5: Multi-Condition Query

```
I bought shoes 3 weeks ago, wore them once, but they're uncomfortable. 
Can I return them even though they've been worn?
```

(chunk 7):

"Footwear may be returned within 30 days if showing only minor indoor 
wear. Shoes showing excessive wear, outdoor damage, or significant 
scuffing are not eligible for return."

‚ö†Ô∏è Worn once - depends on condition
‚ùå If shoes show significant wear marks

**Eligibility Criteria**:
1. **Acceptable**: Minor indoor wear, clean soles, no scuffs
2. **Not Acceptable**: Outdoor wear, dirty soles, visible damage

**Recommendation**:
Bring the shoes to a store for assessment. Our team will evaluate:
- Sole condition
- Upper material condition
- Overall appearance

**Alternative Options**:
If not eligible for return, you may be eligible for:
- Store credit (manager discretion)
- Exchange for different size
- Comfort insole fitting service

Can I return something without a receipt? I lost it.
```

- Valid government-issued ID required

**How It Works**:

4. **Tracking**: System monitors frequency to prevent abuse

**Better Options**:

### Example 12: Multi-Turn Conversation

**Conversation Flow:**

**User:** "What is your return policy?"

**Agent:** *(Provides general return policy overview)*

**User:** "What about electronics specifically?"

**Agent:** *(Provides electronics-specific policy, referencing earlier context)*

**User:** "Can I return an opened laptop?"

**Agent:** 
```
**Opened Electronics Return**:

Based on our discussion of the electronics return policy, here's what 
applies to opened laptops:

According to Electronics Return Policy (chunk 8):
"Opened electronics may be returned within 30 days but are subject to 
a 15% restocking fee. The item must be in like-new condition with all 
original packaging, accessories, and documentation."

**For Your Opened Laptop**:
‚úÖ Returnable within 30 days
‚ö†Ô∏è 15% restocking fee applies
‚úÖ Must have all original items

**Calculation Example**:
- Laptop price: $1,000
- Restocking fee: $150 (15%)
- Refund amount: $850

**To Avoid Restocking Fee**:
Unfortunately, once opened, the fee applies. However, you may consider:
- Exchange for different model (no fee)
- Store credit instead of refund (no fee)
