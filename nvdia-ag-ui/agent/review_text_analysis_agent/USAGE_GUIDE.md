print(f"Negative: {sentiment['percentage_negative']:.1f}%")

# Find specific issues
delivery_reviews = tools.search_reviews_by_keyword("delivery")
print(f"Found {len(delivery_reviews)} delivery-related reviews")

# Analyze common problems
issues = tools.extract_common_issues()
for issue in issues[:5]:
    print(f"{issue['category']}: {issue['frequency']} mentions")
```

## Advanced Usage

### Combining Multiple Tools

```python
# Comprehensive issue analysis
def analyze_critical_issues():
    # Get overall stats
    stats = tools.get_review_statistics()
    
    # Get sentiment breakdown
    sentiment = tools.get_sentiment_breakdown()
    
    # Find common issues
    issues = tools.extract_common_issues()
    
    # Search for specific problems
    delivery = tools.search_reviews_by_keyword("delivery")
    scam = tools.search_reviews_by_keyword("scam")
    
    print(f"Total Reviews: {stats['total_reviews']}")
    print(f"Negative Sentiment: {sentiment['percentage_negative']:.1f}%")
    print(f"\nTop 3 Issues:")
    for i, issue in enumerate(issues[:3], 1):
        print(f"{i}. {issue['category']}: {issue['frequency']} mentions")
    
    print(f"\nDelivery issues: {len(delivery)} reviews")
    print(f"Scam reports: {len(scam)} reviews")

analyze_critical_issues()
```

### Geographic Comparison

```python
def compare_locations(locations):
    for loc in locations:
        reviews = tools.get_reviews_by_location(loc)
        if reviews:
            avg_rating = sum(r['Rating'] for r in reviews) / len(reviews)
            print(f"\n{loc}:")
            print(f"  Reviews: {len(reviews)}")
            print(f"  Avg Rating: {avg_rating:.2f}/5")
            
            # Find top issue
            issues = {}
            for review in reviews:
                text = review['Review'].lower()
                if 'delivery' in text:
                    issues['delivery'] = issues.get('delivery', 0) + 1
                if 'service' in text:
                    issues['service'] = issues.get('service', 0) + 1
            
            if issues:
                top_issue = max(issues.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
                print(f"  Top Issue: {top_issue[0]} ({top_issue[1]} mentions)")

compare_locations(["AZ", "CA", "TX", "FL", "NY"])
```

### Time-based Trend Analysis

```python
def analyze_monthly_trends():
    months = [
        ("July 1, 2023", "July 31, 2023"),
        ("Aug. 1, 2023", "Aug. 31, 2023"),
        ("Sept. 1, 2023", "Sept. 30, 2023")
    ]
    
    for start, end in months:
        reviews = tools.get_reviews_by_date_range(start, end)
        if reviews:
            avg_rating = sum(r['Rating'] for r in reviews) / len(reviews)
            print(f"\n{start[:4]}:")
            print(f"  Count: {len(reviews)}")
            print(f"  Avg Rating: {avg_rating:.2f}/5")

analyze_monthly_trends()
```

## Integration with Main Agent

The Review Text Analysis Agent can be integrated into the main NVIDIA AI Teams agent system:

```python
# In agent/agent.py
from review_text_analysis_agent import agent as review_agent

# Register the review analysis agent
agents = {
    'inventory': inventory_agent,
    'customer_support': customer_support_agent,
    'product_search': product_search_agent,
    'review_analysis': review_agent.root_agent  # Add this
}
```

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Start Broad**: Begin with `get_review_statistics()` to understand the dataset
2. **Drill Down**: Use keyword searches to focus on specific issues
3. **Compare**: Look at multiple dimensions (location, time, rating)
4. **Validate**: Cross-reference findings with multiple tools
5. **Contextualize**: Always relate findings to business impact

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No such file or directory"
**Solution**: Verify the review data CSV is at `review_data/Walmart_reviews_data.csv`

### Issue: "Empty DataFrame"
**Solution**: Check CSV format and ensure data is properly formatted

### Issue: No results from search
**Solution**: Try different keywords or broader search terms

### Issue: Agent not responding
**Solution**: Restart the agent server with `npm run dev`

## Performance Notes

- **Dataset Size**: 300 reviews (lightweight, fast processing)
- **Response Time**: < 1 second for most queries

## Next Steps

1. **Expand Dataset**: Add more reviews for better analysis
2. **Add NVIDIA NIM Integration**: Use embeddings for semantic search
